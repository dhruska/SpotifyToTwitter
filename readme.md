Spotify to Twitter
===
A project to introduce myself to node.js and npm. It will make a tweet every time the song currently being played on Spotify on the user's machine changes and the track time passes 30 seconds.

Some things to note:
 * The api key/secret and access token/secret need to be added for this to work
 * Two packages must be installed with npm - they are 'node-spotify-webhelper' and 'twit'. To do this, run 'npm install _', where _ is the name of the package.
