Spotify to Twitter
===
A project to introduce myself to node.js and npm. It will make a tweet every time the song currently being played on Spotify on the user's machine changes and the track time passes 30 seconds.

Be sure to run a `npm install` to install the required packages.

The api key/secret and access token/secret need to be added for this to work.
